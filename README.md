# TGFM workflow

Please see updated [repository](https://github.com/BennyStrobes/TGFM) if you are interested in running TGFM on your own data!

Scripts developed to reproduce analysis described in "Fine-mapping causal tissues and genes at disease-associated loci" (Strober et al. medRxiv 2023).

"Simulation" directory contains scripts to reproduce analysis of TGFM applied to simulated data and "real_data_analysis" directory contains scripts to reproduce analysis of TGFM applied to 45 UK Biobank diseases and complex traits.
